* Original memory map

As Ghouls is partly BASIC, the BASIC workspace as $400...$7ff is not
available.

26 pages GMC; 39 pages GBAS; 3 pages variables; 1 page BASIC stack.

UseOK indicates whether this region is OK for Ghouls to use in
practice.

Regarding pages marked as maybe useable, OS workspace:

- 0b :: F key definitions on B/B+, Econet stuff on Master
- 0c :: UDGs on B/B+, Econet stuff on Master

B/B+ DFS workspace:

- 11-16 :: DFS random access workspace on B/B+
- 17-18 :: DFS private workspace on B/B+

If not using random access files or changing FS, on B/B+ with DFS,
pages 11-18 are useable.

Not worth supporting non-DFS setups on B/B+.

On Master, PAGE is always $e00, so only page 0d is unusable.

Some notes:

- End of BASIC variables can be seen at $02/$03 (see
  http://8bs.com/basic/memory.htm)

- There's a few places now where strings are built up using `CHR$`,
  rather than just being a literal with embedded control codes. But I
  think such operations are performed in the string work area in page
  6? - so it's only the final length of the string that influences how
  much BASIC heap space is used. So the end result should be the same
  (or near enough)

* Available zero page

- $70...$8f :: BASIC workspace left free for user programs
- $a8...$af :: available between * commands (any * command might
  overwrite)
- $b0...$bf :: available between FS calls (any FS call might
  overwrite)

Possibly also available:

- $50...$70 :: not obviously used by any 6502 version of BBC BASIC, as
  far as I can tell - see
